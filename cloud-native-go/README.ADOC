== Introduction

=== Motivation for cloud native apps

Cloud Native applications:: are applications that are designed for and take full advantage of the uniqueness of the cloud.  They are dynamic, won't break, and scale arbitrarily

1. Hyperscale - increased traffic, data, and application features
2. Antifragility - applications that do not break
3. Continuous delivery and devops
4. Opex savings (automation and utilization)

=== Three key principles of Cloud native applications

1. Built and composed as microservices
2. Packaged and distributed in containers
3. Dynamically executed in the cloud

=== Challenges and Design principles of CNAD

Design for:

1. Performance: Responsive, concurrency, efficiency
2. Automation: Automate dev tasks and ops tasks 
3. Resiliency: Fault tolerant and self healing
4. Elasticity: Dynamically scale up and down and be reactive
5. Delivery: Short round trips and automated delivery
6. Diagnosability: Cluster-wide logs, traces, and metrics

=== Decomposition with Microservices

The anatomy of an Ops Component:

Constraints (mostly technology driven):
- Application does not use kernel space APIs
- Does not listen on random ports
- Does not require an exotic os
- Used endpoints can be configured (DNS name, IPs, Ports)

Container (Application)  has internet protocol interface, a starting interface, a diagnosis interface, and an internet protocol

=== The Cloud Native Stack


- App Platform - Provides runtime environment and APIs for applications

Cluster Operating System:

- Cluster Orchestrator - Dynamically executes applications on the cluster
- Cluster Scheduler - Manages cluster resources and executes containers
- Cluster Virtualization - Decouples resources from physical hardware

=== Basic Docker workflow and Docker commands

docker build -t <tag> .:: Build a docker image with the given tag from the current directory
docker images:: Prints all local images
docker run:: Run a Docker image:  Creates and runs a container
-d:: in background
-e <environment variable>:: with defined ENV variable
-p <host-port>:<container-port>:: with port forwarding from Host to Container
<image> <entrypoint process:: image name and entrypoint process

docker run -ti <image> /bin/sh:: Run a Docker image and open a shell wihtin the container / with forwarding of local terminal / image name and shell

docker ps --all:: Prints all containers(without --all prints only running containers)
docker kill <container>:: Terminate container (send SIGKILL to entrypoint process)
docker rm <container>:: Remove container
docker rmi -f <image>:: Remove local image (use -f to force removal)

=== Build naive Docker image for Go microservice

=== Running containerized Go microservice locally

=== Improving Docker image and Docker compose
